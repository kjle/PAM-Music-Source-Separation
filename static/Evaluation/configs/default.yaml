      name: Introduction
      content: <p align="left">Thank you for participating in this subjective evaluation of music source separation systems. This study aims to assess the perceptual quality of separated music signals using the MUSHRA methodology. Your responses will help us improve the performance of music source separation models.</p><p align="left">During the test, you will be presented with multiple audio samples for each test case. These samples include a reference (original signal), one or more processed signals generated by different source separation algorithms. Your general task is to evaluate the quality of each processed signal.</p> <p align="left">This test is best conducted in a quiet environment using high-quality headphones to ensure accurate assessment.</p>
      # <p>This example for a listening test shows all available tests. Some in random order and some not. They all use the same test item and filtered versions of it as conditions. </p> <br/><p> Before the test starts you can set the volume to your convenience and after the test you get an overview over your results!</p>

        content: In this section, you will evaluate the overall quality of the reconstructed mix for each algorithm. Your task is to choose the audio(s) based on the similarity to the reference. The reference is the original mix containing piano, clarinet, and violin. The processed outputs are the reconstructed mixes obtained by summing the separated signals for each algorithm.
